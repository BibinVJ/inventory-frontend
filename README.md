To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the project.

- **Keep it DRY:** Don't repeat yourself. Utilize existing services, components, and helpers where possible.
- **Permissions over Roles:** Whenever checking for authorization, prefer using specific permissions, hasPermissions("update-customer"). This makes the system more flexible.
